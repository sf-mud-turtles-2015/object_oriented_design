## Object Oriented Design Workshop

### Directions
Today we're going to illustrate principles of object oriented design in Ruby by working in groups to create examples of patterns and antipatterns.  You will have 10-15 minutes in your group to create the presentation.  Then each group will present a 5 minute talk on the whiteboard with:
- a definition of your concept 
- an example of an anti-pattern and some code smells or tips you can use to identify the anti-pattern
- an example of the anti-pattern code refactored according to your principle
- a description of why the refactored code is better

### Principles
- Single responsibility
- Argument order independence
- Dependency injection
- Law of Demeter
- Well-designed interfaces

Everyone in the group must speak at least once during the presentation.

### Goals
- Every person in the cohort is familiar with the definitions of these principles and their implementation in ruby
